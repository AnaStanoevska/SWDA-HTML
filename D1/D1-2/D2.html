    <hr>
    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    <p>
            <b>The Coliseum–Oakland International Airport</b> line, also known informally as the <b>BART to OAK line</b>,[1] is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coliseum%E2%80%93Oakland_International_Airport_line/">automated
            guideway transit</a> (AGT) system operated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit/">Bay Area Rapid Transit</a> (BART) between BART's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Coliseum_station/">Coliseum station</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_International_Airport_station/">Oakland
            International Airport station</a>. The system opened for revenue service on November 22, 2014[2] and is integrated into
            BART’s fare system. During planning and construction, it was known as the <b>Oakland Airport Connector (OAC)</b> project.
    </p>
    <p>     The BART to Oakland International Airport AGT system replaces the former AirBART shuttle bus service. Initially
            operating between two terminal stations, the system includes provisions for an intermediate third station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Maintenance_and_Storage_Facility/">(Doolittle
            Station)</a> that may be built at a later date.[3]

        The Coliseum–Oakland International Airport AGT system is operated by BART and is integrated into BART’s existing fare
        system. However, it does not utilize existing BART rolling stock and it is not physically connected with existing BART
        tracks. Instead it has its own fleet of AGT vehicles that operate on fixed guideways and are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_car_(railway)/">cable-drawn</a>. The guideways
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_Liner/">Cable Liner</a> vehicles were built by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCC_Doppelmayr_Cable_Car/">DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car</a>. The line is designed to have an approximate headway of
        4.5 minutes (though it is currently operated with a headway of 6 minutes) and to complete a one-way trip in
        approximately 8 minutes, with an on-time performance of more than 99.5%.[4][5]
</p>
<p>      
        The initial setup is four 3-car trains (113 passengers each train),[6] but the system can accommodate an expansion to
        four 4-car trains (148 passengers each train). The system has four cable loops and one train per cable. The system uses
        a pinched-loop configuration, with two lines that merge into a single track just before each terminus. Cars switch
        cables during dwell time at the station.[7] The trains automatically switch cables four times: once at each end, and
        halfway between the two stops at the wheelhouse, near the intersection of Hegenberger Road and Airport Access Road. The
        wheelhouse has four 12-foot (3.7 m) drive wheels that move the cables.
</p>       
        The 3.2-mile (5.1 km) AGT route between Oakland Coliseum Station and the airport is mostly elevated, largely in the
        median of Hegenberger Road, with one underground section as it passes under Doolittle Drive, and one at-grade section
        just west of that point, before the AGT enters airport property on an elevated guideway. A maintenance and storage
        facility is located near the midpoint of the system. A two-person team monitors operation of the system from a central
        control room in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Maintenance_and_Storage_Facility/">Doolittle maintenance and storage facility</a>.
<p>        
        The AGT’s connection to the existing BART system at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Coliseum_station/">Coliseum Station</a> resembles the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTrain_JFK/">AirTrain JFK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTrain_Newark/">AirTrain Newark</a>
        airport people movers' existing off-airport connections to other rail transit lines.[original research?] In this case
        however, both the airport people mover and connecting rail transit are "operated by BART and share the same fare system.
        The Airport station's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_area/">fare gates</a> are located at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Coliseum_station/">Coliseum station</a>, between the line's dedicated platform and the
        elevated walkway above San Leandro Street linking it to the original platform. Both stations for the line feature
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_screen_doors/=">platform screen doors</a> – a first for the system.
</p>        
        The line is paralleled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Transit/">AC Transit</a> route 73, which is less frequent but less expensive. Routes 73 and 805 provide
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Nighter_(bus_service)/">overnight service</a> during hours that the Oakland Airport Connector - and the rest of the BART system - are closed.
<p>     
        <h3><b>Fares</b></h3>
</p>
<p>
        On June 12, 2014, the BART Board of Directors voted to set the base fare for travel on the BART to Oakland
        International Airport AGT system at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar/">US$</a>6.[6][8] The Board left open the possibility that temporary promotional fares
        could be introduced in the future. In addition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age#Senior_citizen/">seniors</a>, people with disabilities, and children age 12 and under will
        be eligible for BART's 62.5% discount. Subject to approval, BART staff planned to recommend at a later board meeting
        that airport employees continue to pay a discounted fare of US$2 for the trip on the new service.[6] As of November
        2016, the line operated with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farebox_recovery_ratio/">farebox recovery ratio</a> of 96%.[9] This lower-than-expected revenue, in part due to
        competition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_network_company/">transportation network companies</a>, resulted in a net operating cost of US$860,000 between 2014 and
        2016.[10]

    <p><b>AirBART</b></p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/AirBART_bus_at_Oakland_International_Airport%2C_circa_2008.jpg/330px-AirBART_bus_at_Oakland_International_Airport%2C_circa_2008.jpg">
    <p>AirBART bus at the airport around 2008</p>
    <p>On July 1, 1977, BART began a shuttle bus service called <b>AirBART</b> that ran to the airport terminals from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Coliseum_station#Bus_service/">street level
        at Coliseum station</a> (thereafter named Coliseum/Oakland Airport). The shuttle ride took ten minutes and cost 50
        cents.[11] AirBART was a joint project of BART and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Oakland/">Port of Oakland</a>, which owns and operates the
        airport.[12][13]
    </p>
    <p>As with other BART-branded connecting buses, AirBART was run by private operators under contract. It was operated by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veolia_Transport/">Veolia Transport</a> (Shuttleport) from 2001 to 2012, then by Ampco until 2014.[14][15][13] The diesel bus fleet was
        replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_natural_gas/">compressed natural gas</a> buses around 2008.[16]
    </p>
    <p>At the time of replacement, AirBART ran from 5:00am (8:00am on Sundays) to midnight - approximately matching BART
        operating hours - with nominal headways of ten minutes at most times. Travel time was estimated as 15 minutes.[17]
        However, travel times and frequency were inconsistent due to traffic congestion from commuters and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland%E2%80%93Alameda_County_Coliseum/">Oakland–Alameda
        County</a> Coliseum events.[18]:S-8 Passengers were required to pay the $3 fare with exact change or a $3 BART ticket
        from dedicated fare machines.[17] Because of a dispute between BART and the Port of Oakland about who would pay to
        modify fare equipment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_card/">Clipper Card</a> readers were never installed on the buses.[19]
    </p>
    <p>
        Ridership was 85,000 monthly (about 2,800 per day) in 2008, but dropped to 1,900 daily riders by 2014.[20][21] AirBART
    service was discontinued on November 22, 2014 when the Oakland Airport Connector opened, though buses were kept on
    standby for one week in case the new line experienced failures.[13] The buses were then transferred to airport parking
    shuttle buses to replace diesel buses.[13]
    </p>
<p><b><h3>Funding</h3></b></p>
<p>
    The U$484 million[2] for funding the project came from local government funds (US$275 million, or 57%), state funds
(US$79 million, 16%), federal funds (US$25 million, 5%), and BART deficit spending (US$106 million, 22%).</p>>
<p>
    In late 2009, just prior to the award of the contract to construct the system, the project lost US$70 million of
    federal stimulus funding because the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Transit_Administration/">Federal Transit Administration (FTA)</a> found that BART was out of conformance
    with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_VI/">Title VI</a> of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Among other non-OAC considerations, the FTA cited that BART did not
    complete the necessary analysis to determine if the future change in service would disproportionately impact
    low-income or minority communities. The FTA forced the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to reallocate the
    funding.[22]
</p>
<p>
    By September 2010, all necessary federal and state funding for the Oakland Airport Connector had been re-established,
    and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundbreaking/">groundbreaking ceremony</a> was held on October 20, 2010 featuring key administrators: BART Director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Ward_Allen/">Carole Ward
    Allen</a>, Congresswoman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Lee/">Barbara Lee</a>, State Assemblyman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandr%C3%A9_Swanson/">Sandré Swanson</a>, Oakland Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Dellums/">Ron Dellums</a> and Oakland City
    Councilman Larry Reid.[23]
