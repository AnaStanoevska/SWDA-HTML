    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                                                                        
    <p>The <b>Bvumba Mountains</b> or <b>Vumba Mountains</b> straddle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe/">Zimbabwe</a>-<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique/">Mozambique</a>
        border, and are situated some 25 km south east of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutare/">Mutare</a>. The <b>Bvumba</b> rise to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Beacon/">Castle Beacon</a> at 1,911 metres, and
        are, together with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimanimani/">Chimanimani</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyanga_National_Park/">Nyanga</a> part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Highlands/">Eastern Highlands</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicaland_Province/">Manicaland</a> and adjacent
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manica_Province/">Manica provinces</a>. They are referred to as the "Mountains of the Mist" (Bvumba being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shona_language/">Shona</a> word for "mist"),
        as so often the early morning starts
        with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mist/">mist</a> which clears by mid-morning. Although lying mostly within Zimbabwe, the mountains extend
        north-eastward to Mount Vumba (or Monte Vumba) in Mozambique.[1] They are capped by cool, green hills which
        shelter country hotels, a casino and golf course at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_Rock_Hotel/">Leopard Rock Hotel</a> and a Botanical Garden with one of
        the best views in Africa.[2] The mountains are also known for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee/">coffee</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation/">plantations</a>.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h2>Access</h2>
    On the Zimbabwean side, the Mountains are accessible by a tarred road (with many potholes) from Mutare. The Mozambican
    side of the mountains can be reached from a road to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vumba_Water_Bottling_Plant/">Vumba Water Bottling Plant</a>, which leaves the main EN6 highway
    just west of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manica,_Mozambique/">Manica</a>.
    <h2>Mountain hikes</h2>
    <hr/>
    The climb to the prominence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Beacon/">Castle Beacon</a>, is up a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inselberg/">granite dome</a>. The lower slopes form a mist belt with
    sub-montane vegetation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protea/">Proteas</a> are found on the higher levels.[3] Vumba Mountain, on the Mozambique side, is a steep
    hike to a summit with a good view of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manica,_Mozambique/">Manica</a> and environs.[4]
    <h2>Geology</h2>
    <hr/>
    The Bvumba Mountains are composed mainly of granite which forms the eastern margin of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe_Craton/">Zimbabwe craton</a>. The Vumba
    granite has been dated at over 2,600 Ma.[5] The granites are intruded in places by Umkondo dolerite sills[6] which are
    dated to about 1,110 Ma.[7][8]
    <h2>Flora</h2>
    <hr/>
    The mountains are dominated by savannah woodland, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachystegia/">Brachystegia</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miombo/">miombo</a>. There are also extensive sub-montane
    grasslands, local mist-belts with mosses and epiphytic and lithophytic ferns and sub-montane evergreen forest in the
    deeper ravines.[9][10][11] The higher levels of the mountains are sparsely vegetated with shrubs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protea/">proteas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe/">aloes</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strelitzia/">Strelitzia</a>.[3]
    In the centre of the mountains lies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunga_Forest_Botanical_Reserve/">Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve</a> and neighbouring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bvumba_Botanical_Garden/">Bvumba Botanical Garden</a>. The
    latter is landscaped around a number of small streams and includes an important cycad collection, with 59 of the 189
    known species, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_manikensis/">Encephalartos manikensis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_ferox/">E. ferox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_lehmannii/">E. lehmannii</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_pterogonus/">E. pterogonus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_cycadifolius/">E. cycadifolius</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_eugene-maraisii/">E.
    eugene-maraisii.</a>[12]
    <h2>Fauna</h2>
    <hr/>
    Although small in area, the mountains are a botanical paradise and home to some of the rarest butterflies in the
    region. The Bvumba mountains offer exciting and varied birding opportunities. The area is probably best known as one of
    the main breeding areas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swynnerton%27s_robin/">Swynnerton's robin</a>[13] which lives and breeds in small patches of forest, some on private
    land, others within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunga_Forest_Botanical_Reserve/">Bunga forest</a>.[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingstone%27s_turaco/">Livingstone's turacos</a> are present in large numbers. Their territorial calls
    are typically heard long before they are seen, yet their brilliant crimson wing feathers are striking from afar as they
    glide from one patch of canopy to another. A smaller number of mammals inhabit the Bvumba, perhaps the most notable of
    which are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard/">leopard</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_monkey/">samango</a> monkey, the latter's range being very limited. Savannah woodland adjoining the
    Mozambique side of the range is home to several rare reptiles including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall%27s_pygmy_chameleon/">Marshall's leaf chameleon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscelotes_arnoldi/">Arnold's
    skink</a>.[11]
    <h2>Archaeology</h2>
    <hr/>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinhamapere_Hill">Chinhamapere Hill</a>, on the Mozambique side of the mountains, has been a culturally important site since the Iron Age.
    There are well-preserved hunter-gatherer rock art paintings (comprising several human figures, some holding bows and
    arrows and others in trance) thought to be of around 8,000 years in age, as well as contemporary ritual sites, used for
    rainmaking, divining and healing.[11] There are at least 86 stone age sites in the Zimbabwean portion of the mountains,
    and the cultural significance of some of these are still observed at the present time.[14]
    <h2>World Heritage Status</h2>
    <hr/>
    This site was added to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO/">UNESCO</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_site/">World Heritage</a> Tentative List on August 20, 2008 in the Cultural category.[15] It was proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique/">Mozambique</a>.
